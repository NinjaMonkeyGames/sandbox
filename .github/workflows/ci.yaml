# 🚩 FIX APPLIED HERE 🚩
# The 'on' block specifies the events that trigger the workflow.
on:
  # 1. Trigger on 'push' events
  push:
    branches:
      - master      # Triggers on push to 'master' (Production)
      - release     # Triggers on push to 'release'
      - staging     # Triggers on push to 'staging'
      - '*'         # Catch-all for other branches (Development/Feature)
      
  # 2. Trigger on 'pull_request' events (optional, but often useful)
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
      - release
      - staging
      - '*'
